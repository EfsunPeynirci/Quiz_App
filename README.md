# Quiz App

When you open the Quiz application, a question comes to you one by one. The answers to our questions are either right or wrong. You proceed by clicking on the answer you see fit. The total number of questions is 6.

When we answer the question correctly, a tick mark appears below. If you answer the question incorrectly, a cross is displayed.

After answering a total of 6 questions, it guides you. If you want to play the game again, just press the "try again" button. If you want to exit the game, you can press the "exit" button.

After pressing the try again button, the game will start again. But this time, the questions will appear in a shuffled way.
